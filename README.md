# Simple calculator

Simple beginner JavaScript project, handles nearly every basic operation.

### Known issues

- the calculator cannot handle multipication and division with a negative second operand, due to the current implementation of the negative sign
- typing in numbers like 0.003 is possible and will compute correctly, but they are not displayed until the first non-zero digit is typed
